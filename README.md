Assignment Six - Unit Tests

Description
Unit Testing will be an important aspect of validating the behavior of your code and system as it is iteratively developed.  A common tool for performing this validation is Unit Testing. For this assignment, you will work with a new pair from within your team to complete the following.

Requirements
First, complete these tutorials:

Unit testing C# in .NET Core using dotnet test and xUnit - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test
Razor Pages unit tests in ASP.NET Core - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/razor-pages-tests?view=aspnetcore-5.0

Next, you will revising assignment three to "back port" unit tests into that solution. Moving forward, each team's code needs to have as much test coverage as possible for each sprint.
